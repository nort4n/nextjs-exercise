# Git

![[personal-site-md/resources/cheatsheet git.png]]

Git is a widely used tool and interface for project collaboration and version control.

[github](www.github.com) is a web community to create and collaborate on projects.

## Core concepts

repository - database of a coding project
local/remote - work on a project/repo takes place locally, changes can then be published/pushed to the remote version of the repo
centralised/distributed - repos can be located on several machines, which increases safety and allows for collaboration in parallel
